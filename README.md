# quazip-mirror
A git mirror of the SVN repo for quazip found at https://sourceforge.net/projects/quazip/.

This is to help people include quazip as a submodule and have access to the raw
unedited repo in git format. I in no way take credit for the work.

All credit goes to Sergey A. Tachenov and all other contributors that helped make this
amazing repository.
